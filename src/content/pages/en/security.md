At Tejory, security isn't a feature; it's the bedrock of our foundation. The heart of every Tejory Core wallet is a state-of-the-art EAL6+ certified Secure Element. This is not merely bank-grade security; it's the same class of tamper-resistant hardware trusted to protect critical data in national security and intelligence applications. This chip acts as an impenetrable vault for your private keys, providing physical and cryptographic protection against a sophisticated range of threats, from side-channel attacks to direct physical manipulation. Your digital assets are isolated within this fortified environment, ensuring they remain under your exclusive control, no matter the external risks.

Our commitment to security extends beyond robust hardware to radical transparency. We believe that true trust is earned through independent verification. To that end, the firmware for our JavaCard-based operating system is currently undergoing an exhaustive audit by a leading third-party cybersecurity firm. This meticulous, line-by-line review is designed to rigorously test our code and cryptographic implementations for any potential vulnerabilities. In the spirit of full transparency and our confidence in our architecture, we are committed to publishing the complete audit results for the public to review as soon as they are finalized.

Looking to the future, we are actively preparing for the next generation of cryptographic challenges. Tejory Core is built with support for Post-Quantum TLS (PQTLS), ensuring that the communication channels you use to manage your assets are fortified against the looming threat of quantum computing. By implementing algorithms resistant to quantum attacks, we are future-proofing the security of your portfolio. This forward-thinking approach ensures that your assets are protected not just against the threats of today, but for decades to come, providing enduring peace of mind in an evolving digital world.
